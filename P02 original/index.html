    <section id="about_company">>
      <h2>About Company</h2>
      <p>Our company sells unique, unusual, cute, and pretty jewelry to women customers who are looking for unique items that are not trapped in the trend or classic. The characteristic of this company's product is that many designs stand out in colors and have a unique design as possible rather than selling simple design items. Since Little Precious Jewel is a company that thinks about customers' fashion styles and environment, it makes products of the best quality and boasts quality that customers can use for more than 10 years without throwing those away. We also provide accessories such as sunglasses and hair accessories. Since the quality and the design of the product is outstanding we are aiming for an everyday luxury brand. </p>
        <h3>Potential Customer</h3>
          <p>There are so many fashion items in the world. Among them, some people are looking for fashion items that only they have and can digest, not the design that everyone else has. However, most fashion brands design to suit the trend of the year and make many classic and steady designs. Customers who are tired of the style they see all the time will find accessories with the most unusual design. Our main customers will be those who want to feel happy that they have found a design that they can only have and cannot find anywhere else. Also, those who like to wear simple outfits and give points with very unusual accessories and jewelry can be our customers.</p>

        <h3>Why might this company entice someone to purchase a product or service?</h3>
          <p>It will catch people's attention with websites and stores with easy-to-use and pretty designs, and people will also be interested if it is emphasized that all of our products are good quality product. 
                We live in a time when we boast our fashion and life in any types of SNS. If we ask famous influencers to use our products, women who want to copy the influencers will be very interested.</p>
